# ⚖️ Pounds to Kilograms Converter

A small JS project that converts **pounds → kilograms**.  
After submitting a value, it **waits 3 seconds** before showing the result.  
If the input is invalid, an error appears instead.  

👉 Used **`setTimeout` / `clearTimeout`** to handle the delay, error reset, and auto-clear.

## 🚀 Features
- Shows result 3 seconds after submit  
- Error handling for invalid inputs  
- Clears result automatically after 4 seconds  
- Simple, lightweight, and mobile-friendly

**PS:** (There’s also an **auto-calculate after 3 seconds of typing** version written in the code but commented out.)
